  <p> Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 â€“ October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman who has been described as America's greatest inventor. He played a significant part in introducing the modern age of electricity. His inventions included the phonograph, the carbon-button transmitter for the telephone speaker and microphone, the incandescent lamp, the first commercial electric light and power system, an experimental electric railroad, and key elements of motion-picture equipment. And some of his favourite Quotes are : - 1. Never get discouraged if you fail. Learn from it. Keep trying.
2. Learn with both your head and hands.
3. Not everything of value in life comes from books- experience the world.
4. Never stop learning. Read the entire panorama of literature. 1."Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time."
2. "Just because something doesn't do what you planned it to do doesn't mean it's useless."
3."There is no substitute for hard work."
4. "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."
5. "If we did all the things we are capable of, we would literally astound ourselves."
6. "What you are will show in what you do."
7. "Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work." </p>
